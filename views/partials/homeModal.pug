                |                   The applications are now open for people interested in social work from the age of 15 to 40. Fellows would be expected to participate in the events organised by our Foundation and take initiatives to plan more events. However, they would not be required to work 24*7 on all events. They will have the option to opt out of certain events if the events do not match their field of work. But, in order to get a certificate, a minimum number of hours/events would be mandatory for the year.
